Add onion, red bell pepper, and green chilli and spread into an even layer. Cook, without stirring, until vegetables on the bottom are browned, about 2-3 minutes. Stir and repeat. Continue to cook until vegetables are fully softened and spottily charred, about another 2 minutes. Add garlic, chilli powder and cumin and cook, stirring, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and stir to combine."
